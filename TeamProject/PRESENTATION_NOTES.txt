2-3 slides for class: explain our project simply


SLIDE 1: THE PROBLEM
---------------------------------

The big idea (say this in plain language):

  "We want to predict CO2 levels in the ocean using satellite temperature
   data. Buoys measure CO2 directly, but there are only 7 of them. Satellites
   measure temperature everywhere but can't see CO2. So we're asking:
   can we learn the relationship between temperature and CO2 at buoy sites,
   then use that to predict CO2 anywhere a satellite can see?"

Why it matters:
  - pCO2 (partial pressure of CO2) tells us how much carbon the ocean
    is absorbing — important for understanding climate change
  - But we can only measure it at a handful of buoy locations
  - Satellites give us SST (sea surface temperature) across the entire ocean
  - If SST can predict pCO2, we can estimate carbon uptake everywhere

Our two data sources:

  BUOYS (the "answer key")                SATELLITES (the "predictor")
  - 7 NOAA sites across US waters        - JPL MUR SST via NOAA ERDDAP
  - Directly measure pCO2 at surface     - ~4.6 km resolution, daily
  - 26,000+ records, 2013-2025           - 61,500 records, 2015-2025
  - This is our TARGET variable           - This is our INPUT feature
    (what we want to predict)               (what we train the model on)

  Locations: Southern CA, La Push (WA), Coastal Louisiana,
  Grays Reef (GA), First Landing (VA), South Pacific, SE Bering Sea


SLIDE 2: WHAT WE'VE DONE SO FAR
---------------------------------

The key idea (say this):

  "At buoy locations, we have BOTH satellite SST and buoy-measured pCO2
   on the same dates. So we paired them up to create training data:
   'on this day, at this spot, the satellite saw this temperature,
   and the buoy measured this CO2 level.' Those pairs are what we
   train the model on."

What we did, step by step:

  1. DEFINED BOUNDING BOXES to download satellite data
     - BEFORE any cleaning or merging, we decided what satellite
       data to actually pull from the ERDDAP API
     - For each buoy, we created a ±1° lat/lon box around its
       known coordinates (about 220 km × 220 km of ocean)
     - Used those boxes as the spatial bounds in ERDDAP queries
       to download only satellite SST near our buoy sites
     - This was the very first step — it determined what
       satellite data we had to work with going forward

  2. CLEANED both datasets separately
     - Removed bad values (-999 null codes), standardized dates
     - Satellite: 61,510 rows  |  Buoy: 26,000+ rows

  3. SPATIALLY AVERAGED the satellite data
     - For each day at each buoy location, averaged all satellite
       grid cells within the bounding box into one SST value
     - This smooths out small-scale noise and gives a more
       reliable SST estimate than a single pixel would

  4. MATCHED satellite SST to buoy pCO2 by date and location
     - Paired the box-averaged satellite SST with the buoy's
       pCO2 reading from the same date
     - This creates our training pairs: SST (input) → pCO2 (target)

  5. IDENTIFIED continuous measurement windows
     - Buoys don't run 24/7 — there are gaps in the pCO2 data
     - We found the time windows where each buoy had consistent,
       real measurements (no gaps > 30 days)
     - We only want to train on REAL data, not fill in gaps ourselves

  Best continuous data windows we found:
     Southern CA:   536 days,  7,903 records  (best quality)
     LA Buoy:       610 days,  3,702 records
     First Landing: 343 days,  3,916 records
     Greys Reef:    1,461 days, 3,889 records
     South Pacific: 731 days,  3,083 records
     La Push & Bering Sea: shorter, more fragmented

Why we train on satellite SST (not buoy SST):
  - The model will eventually predict using satellite data as input
  - So it should learn from satellite measurements specifically
  - Satellite and buoy SST are similar but not identical (different
    instruments), so training on satellite SST avoids a mismatch


SLIDE 3 (or 4): BOUNDING BOX & SPATIAL MATCHING
---------------------------------

The key idea (say this):

  "When we pull satellite SST for each buoy, we don't grab just
   one pixel. We define a bounding box — a square area around the
   buoy — and average all the satellite measurements in that box
   into one temperature value per day."

What the audience should understand:

  - Our box is ±1° in every direction, which is about 220 km × 220 km
  - That's on the larger side for this kind of work
  - For comparison:
      * Satellite validation studies typically use ~25 km
      * Regional coastal studies use ~10-25 km
      * Global pCO2 gridded products (SOCAT) use ~110 km (1° × 1°)
      * Ours is 220 km (2° × 2°)

Why it matters:

  - Most of our buoys sit near coastlines
  - A 220 km box near a coast can easily reach across shore,
    upwelling zones, or completely different water masses
  - That means the averaged SST might not reflect what the buoy
    is actually experiencing — diluting the signal
  - Open-ocean sites (like South Pacific) are fine with a big box
    because SST is pretty uniform out there

What we plan to do about it:

  - Test smaller boxes (±0.25° or ±0.1°) and compare model accuracy
  - Possibly use different box sizes for coastal vs. open-ocean sites
  - This is a natural next step for improving model performance


SLIDE 4 (or 5): WHAT'S NEXT
---------------------------------

Where we are now (say this):

  "We have our training data paired and cleaned. The next step is
   to actually train a model and see how well satellite temperature
   can predict ocean CO2."

Decisions we need to make:

  1. Which location(s) to start with?
     - Start simple: one site with the best data (Southern CA)
     - Then expand to multiple sites to see if the model generalizes

  2. Which ML model to try first?
     - Random Forest is a good starting point for environmental data
     - Later: could try neural networks, XGBoost, etc.

  3. How do we know if it works?
     - Split data: 80% for training, 20% for testing
     - Compare predicted pCO2 vs actual measured pCO2
     - Metrics: R-squared (how much variance explained),
       RMSE (how far off on average)

The end goal:

  "If the model works, we could feed it satellite SST from anywhere
   in the ocean — not just buoy locations — and get a pCO2 prediction.
   That would let us estimate ocean carbon uptake across huge areas
   where we currently have no direct measurements."
