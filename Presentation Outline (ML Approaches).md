### Slide 1: Team introductions (all approx 1- minute)

### Slide 2: Project Overview (Colin) (approx 1 minute)

### Slide 3: Background Literature  (Colin) (1 minute)
 - what work has been done on this problem? 
 - have people used machine learning and if so what approaches did they use? 
 - how are SST and PCO2 related 
### Slide 4: Training Data Overview  (Mary) (1 minute)
 - quick slide that goes over our inputs and outputs, chlrophyl a and SST will be our inputs, pCO2 is the output 
 - include data sources 
### Slide 5: How do we plant to implement the data? (Ellie) (2 minutes)
- Akshay keeps emphasizing that he wants us to have a solid "vision" so this slides serves to explain how we want to go about preparing our data to input into the model
- our current plan is to use 4km grids of temperature and chlorophyll matched with areas we have pco2 data
- discuss what needs to be done with the data to prepare it 
### Slide 6: Chlorophyll A (Arya) (1 minute) 
- show examples and walk through an example of the chlorophyll a data at one of our buoy locations 
### slide 7: SST data (Arya) (1 minute)
- show examples and walk through an example of the SST data at one of our buoy locations 
- also could include table with lat long info for sst and do the same for chlorophyll a 
### Slide 8: pco2 data (Mary) (1 minute)
- highlight buoy locations 
- show lat/long and pco2 examples 
- what time frame are the data continous for
